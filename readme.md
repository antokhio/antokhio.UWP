# antokhio UWP widget lib

Some leftovers from projects...

* UWP Keyboard

Tried to build that as self-contained as possible, with in mind for further styling.
Currently works with two layouts, normal and CAPS. 
Layouts adjustable for switching language, multilanguage will need extra work support.
Right now, will work only with same number of buttons for both layouts.
Selection handling added.

*Known bug: Tab looses focus after passing last element*
